# MyGPT — React + Vite

A small React starter built with Vite. This project includes a minimal development setup with ESLint and Tailwind-ready dependencies so you can focus on building features quickly.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (v16+) and npm/yarn

Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd react-ai-tool
npm install
```

Run the development server with hot reload:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

Lint the codebase:

```powershell
npm run lint
```

## Project structure (important files)

- `index.html` — app entry HTML
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry point
- `src/App.jsx` — main App component
- `src/index.css` and `src/App.css` — styles
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration
- `.gitattributes` — enforces LF line endings in repo

## Notes

- This starter uses Vite for fast dev server and build. See `package.json` for available scripts.
- `.gitattributes` was added to normalize line endings (LF) across platforms.
